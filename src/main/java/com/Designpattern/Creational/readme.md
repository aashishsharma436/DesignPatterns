## Creational Design pattern
- Creational Design patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems to object creation.
- They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- It gives a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates, who creates it, and how it gets created.

**There are two main themes in this pattern:**
- They keep information about the specific classes used in the system hidden.
- They hide the details of how instances of these classes are created and assembled.

**Benefits**
- They allow for greater flexibility in object creation. By decoupling the process on instantiation from the rest of the system,
  you can easily change the class being instantiated without affecting other components.
- These patterns encapsulate the logic of object creation, which simplifies code management and promotes cleaner, more organized code.
- By centralizing the creation logic, the pattern promotes reusability. You can use the same creation methods across different parts of application.
- They help manage complex object creation processes, making it easier to handle configurations and dependencies, especially when dealing with many related classes.
